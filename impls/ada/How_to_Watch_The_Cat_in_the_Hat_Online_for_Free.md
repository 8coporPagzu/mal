However, not everyone is a fan of The Cat in the Hat. The film received mostly negative reviews from critics and audiences, who criticized its departure from the original book, its crude humor, its tone, and its portrayal of the Cat. The film has a 9% rating on Rotten Tomatoes[^3^], with the consensus: \"Filled with double entendres and potty humor, this Cat falls flat.\"
 
Some of the critics who panned the film include Roger Ebert, who gave it one star out of four and wrote: \"Dr. Seuss' The Cat in the Hat is a triumph above all of production design. That's partly because the production design is so good, partly because the movie is so disappointing. It's another overwrought clunker like How the Grinch Stole Christmas, all effects and stunts and CGI and prosthetics, with no room for lightness and joy.\"[^2^]
 
Another critic who disliked the film was Nell Minow of Common Sense Media, who gave it two stars out of five and warned parents: \"There is surprisingly rude and crude humor including double entendres and almost-swearing, potty humor, and other bodily function jokes. The Cat picks up a muddy garden implement and refers to it as 'a dirty hoe' and spells out the s-word. The Cat is hit in the crotch. There's a lot of comic peril that may be too intense for younger children.\"[^1^]
 
The film was also a disappointment at the box office, grossing $134 million worldwide against a budget of $109 million. It also caused Dr. Seuss' widow, Audrey Geisel, to refuse any further live-action adaptations of her late husband's works. She later approved animated versions of Horton Hears a Who!, The Lorax, and The Grinch.
